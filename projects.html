                    <p class="text-l">From April 2017 to August 2017, I travelled to China to document my family's ancestral homes in rural Hubei and Hunan. My goal was to make a family history, interview and spend time with my grandparents, and paint and photograph the scenes of the countryside. I spent the 8 months beforehand preparing by learning how to read and write Chinese, and read as much as I could on Chinese fiction, history, and philosophy.

I typically use pen and watercolours, with some occasional pencil and marker.

Shottle is a two chambered bottle that utilizes an engineered spring loaded lid to encourage users to drink more water alongside alcohol consumption. The lid's default position opens to the water compartment, and requires the user to twist and sip to access the alcohol. The lid returns to the water position once the user lets go.
